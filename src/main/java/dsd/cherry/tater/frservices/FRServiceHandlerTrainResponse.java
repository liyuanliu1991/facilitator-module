     * changed later.
     * @param serviceName The name of the service, should be identical to the service name or ID provided elsewhere.
     * @param serviceResponded True if the service responded within the allotted timeout period; false otherwise.
     * @param FRPersonID The ID of the person whose identity has been or is being trained. Note that in the case that
     *                   the service returns its own internally-generated ID, that ID should be returned here.
     *                   Otherwise, return the internal ID supplied by the ServiceManager unchanged.
     * @param isTrained True if the service is sufficiently trained; false otherwise.
